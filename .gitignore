# Notes
- This backend focuses on clarity and ready-to-run completeness. It is intentionally minimal (no refresh tokens, no role system) but production-ready patterns are used: Prisma, bcrypt, JWT, helmet, rate-limit, nodemailer.
- After you run migrations, create an email app password or use a testing mail trap for `EMAIL_USER`/`EMAIL_PASS`.
